  SLOW::ARBO   ← this marker IS this note. Wherever it appears, all of
               it applies: in a file, a commit, a doc, or from Mike.
  STOP. READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE ONE CHARACTER OF THIS FILE.
  Owner instruction from Mike, 2026-08-03. This is not decoration and it
  is not optional. It is here because this is the point in a build where
  things get broken by moving fast, and that already happened to him once
  on the website. It does not happen here.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SLOW DOWN. DRASTICALLY. Then:

  1. READ EVERY LINE BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE. Every line, every letter,
     slowly. You are not skimming to find the spot to change — you are
     building a model of what this file already does. If you cannot say
     what the code above and below your edit does, you have not read it.

  2. AN AUDIT IS READ-ONLY. If you were asked to audit, you do not edit.
     You do not "fix it while you are in there." You do not refactor, or
     tidy, or rename. You READ, and you REPORT. Editing during an audit
     is disobeying the instruction, full stop.

  3. THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE. What does this already handle? What depends
     on it? What breaks downstream? Recognise the PATTERN before you call
     something a bug — most things in here that look wrong are a
     deliberate correction. Check docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md first. Use what
     you already know about this codebase instead of re-deciding it.

  4. BRING IT TO MIKE — DO NOT DECIDE IT. Anything that looks wrong,
     ambiguous, or outside what was asked: say it and WAIT. Flagging
     costs one sentence. Deciding on his behalf has cost real work and
     real money more than once.

  5. DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED. Not the adjacent thing. Not the bigger
     thing you thought of on the way. Not the cleanup. Exactly what was
     asked, and nothing else.

  If you are moving fast right now, you are already off the rails.

  Remember the marker: SLOW::ARBO

# PROGRESS

Every task, its status, its test result (brief §0, rule 6).
Legend: ☐ todo · ◐ in progress · ☑ done (test passing)

## Phase 0 — Foundation & guardrails-as-config

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| 0.1 | Repo scaffold + docs seeded (README, PROGRESS, DECISIONS, .gitignore) | ☑ | n/a (structure) |
| 0.2 | Env/secrets handling (.env gitignored, .env.example, secret hygiene) | ☑ | `secrets.test.ts` — repo has no secrets |
| 0.3 | Supabase project connection wired via env; app boots & reports config | ◐ | `boot.test.ts` — boot loads configs ✓ (live Supabase pending real keys) |
| 0.4 | `policy/guardrails.json` authored (§3 source of truth) | ☑ | `guardrails.test.ts` |
| 0.5 | `legal/compliance.json` authored (§4 source of truth) — **AUDIT after this task** | ☑ | `legal.test.ts` |
| 0.6 | Config loader + Zod schemas validate both configs at boot | ☑ | `guardrails.test.ts`, `legal.test.ts` |
| 0.7 | Forbidden-string guard (Suffolk / TCIA) fails build on violation | ☑ | `forbiddenStrings.test.ts` |
| 0.8 | Design tokens (§9: color/type/spacing/radius) delivered + documented | ☑ | `designTokens.test.ts` |
| 0.9 | CI (GitHub Actions): install → typecheck → lint → test → secret-scan | ☑ | CI workflow runs `npm run check` |
| 0.10 | Phase 0 audit (§11) + docs updated; present & stop for sign-off | ☑ | audit passed (see below) |

## Phase 0 audit (§11) — result

Run at Phase 0 end. `npm run check` green: 28 tests pass, typecheck + lint clean; `npm run boot` succeeds.

1. **Guardrails intact?** ✅ price/diagnosis/credential(no-TCIA)/service-area(no-Suffolk) suites pass.
2. **Legal gates intact?** ✅ consent, quiet-hours (8–21), STOP-suppression, disclosure line all present & unit-tested. (Runtime enforcement lands with the first outbound feature, Phase 5 — gates are configured now.)
3. **Tests green?** ✅ 28/28, none skipped.
4. **No regressions?** ✅ n/a (first phase).
5. **Data integrity?** ✅ n/a (schema is Phase 1).
6. **Secrets clean?** ✅ `secrets.test.ts` scans the tree — no secret-shaped strings; `.env` gitignored.
7. **Docs current?** ✅ PROGRESS + DECISIONS reflect reality (incl. D7a discovered this phase).
8. **Scope honest?** ✅ nothing from 5B (OUT) or 5C (optional) built.
9. **Rabbit-hole check?** One open item, named not silent: live Supabase connection (task 0.3) awaits the real project + keys — see O1/O3 in DECISIONS. Everything else is complete and tested.

**Acceptance (Phase 0):** app boots; policy + legal config load and are
unit-tested; secrets never in repo; docs seeded; design tokens delivered.

### Notes
- 0.3 resolved: dedicated Supabase project **`arbor`** (`wdpyysgxmwvvoyveihum`,
  us-east-1) created and live. Boot + config validation complete and tested.

## Phase 1 — The data spine

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| 1.1 | Dedicated Supabase project `arbor` provisioned (free tier) | ☑ | project ACTIVE_HEALTHY |
| 1.2 | §7 schema + migrations applied (13 tables, RLS service-role-only) | ☑ | `list_tables` — all present, RLS on |
| 1.3 | Service area enforced in DB (city CHECK; Suffolk impossible) | ☑ | live: Suffolk insert rejected by constraint |
| 1.4 | Address normalization — no double twins (§12) + ZIP capture | ☑ | `address.test.ts` (8) |
| 1.5 | Supabase service-role client wiring | ☑ | `boot.test.ts`; typecheck |
| 1.6 | Repository CRUD (property/contact/lead/estimate/job/contract/photo) | ☑ | `spine.integration.test.ts` (guarded) + live SQL chain verified |
| 1.7 | Function search_path hardening (advisor 0011) — **AUDIT after this** | ☑ | `get_advisors` security clean |
| 1.8 | Google Drive per-property folders + Client Master index writes | ☑ | `drive.test.ts` (3) + **live folders created in owner's Drive** |
| 1.9 | Phase 1 audit (§11) + docs | ☑ | audit passed (below) |

**Acceptance (Phase 1):** create Property/Contact/Estimate/Job/Photo/Contract
end-to-end ✅ (verified live); **Drive folders auto-create per property** ✅
(live "ARBOR Clients" tree created in the owner's Drive; idempotent code + tests).
Production runtime auth for the Drive API (service account vs OAuth) is wired at
deploy — see DECISIONS O3.

## Phase 3 — Booking, color-coding & ZIP clustering

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| 3.1 | Auth-agnostic Google Calendar client (list/create events) | ☑ | typecheck; live create+delete verified |
| 3.2 | Color mapping per event kind (avoids the payment red /11) | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` |
| 3.3 | Availability: working days/hours, realistic-day factor, no double-booking | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` |
| 3.4 | ZIP/route clustering — same-ZIP work scored higher | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` |
| 3.5 | Scheduler: recommend ranked slots, **never auto-commit** (§5A #11) — **AUDIT** | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` |

**Acceptance (Phase 3):** a booked estimate lands **color-correct** (verified
live: colorId 9 estimate created on the real calendar, then deleted), clustered
near same-ZIP work, **without double-booking**; recommendations **require
explicit approval** (booking throws otherwise). 98 tests pass.

### Phase 3 audit (§11) — result
94→98 tests pass, typecheck + lint clean. Guardrails/legal ✅ (unchanged, still
green). No regressions ✅. Recommend-don't-commit enforced in code
(`ApprovalRequiredError`) ✅. Double-booking blocked (`DoubleBookingError`) ✅.
Colors avoid Mike's payment red; no Sunday bookings ✅. Rabbit-hole: color
mapping is a sensible default pending Mike's confirmation (O4) — named, not
silent. Timezone handled via Intl (no ad-hoc offset math).

## Phase 2/3 hardening — from the expanded brief (Section 3.6–3.29)

Applied after the brief expanded from 5 to 29 guardrail subsections. Core golden
rules (3.1–3.5) unchanged; these add the operational depth.

| Area | Status | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Calendar-write format `Name - SOURCE - phone`, scope in description (§3.22) | ☑ | `eventFormat.test.ts` |
| Afternoon-only 30-min estimate window, mornings protected (§3.11) | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` |
| Incident escalation — angry/damage/injury → Mike's cell, never admit fault (§3.9) | ☑ | `intent.test.ts`, `receptionist.test.ts` |
| "I want a person" routing (§3.8) | ☑ | `intent.test.ts`, `receptionist.test.ts` |
| Spam/solicitor screening — never a lead, customer-biased (§3.7, §3.26) | ☑ | `intent.test.ts`, `receptionist.test.ts` |
| Name-first call-open, disclosure after the name (§3.10) | ☑ | `systemPrompt.test.ts` |
| Missed-call text-back copy (§3.21) | ☑ (config) | `systemPrompt.test.ts` |

**Deferred (needs work/accounts/decisions):** learn Mike's real source/city color
map from the live calendar (O4); real ZIP-adjacency graph across the 4 cities;
multi-channel lead intake wiring (Google Ads/LSA/CallRail emails) — Phase 5;
outbound sends (follow-up/quote/reactivation) — Phase 6 behind the TCPA gate.
116 tests pass total.

## Phase 2 — Inbound voice reception (the brain)

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| 2.1 | Receptionist system prompt assembled from config (single source of truth) | ☑ | `systemPrompt.test.ts` (4) |
| 2.2 | Output guard — price/diagnosis/forbidden enforced in CODE, not just prompt | ☑ | `outputGuard.test.ts` (many) |
| 2.3 | Emergency detection → alert to Mike | ☑ | `emergency.test.ts` (13) |
| 2.4 | Lead qualification state machine (§3.3) + power-line red flag | ☑ | `qualification.test.ts` (5) |
| 2.5 | Receptionist orchestrator + clean lead capture — **AUDIT after this** | ☑ | `receptionist.test.ts` (4) |
| 2.6 | Live LeadSink over Phase 1 repositories | ☑ | typecheck; used by orchestrator |
| 2.7 | Voice platform wiring — **ElevenLabs Agents** (D39, supersedes Vapi): custom-LLM bridge over the Receptionist (`/voice/llm/chat/completions`, guard-before-stream, session TTL, fail-closed auth), Anthropic brain (`claude-opus-5`, latency-tuned, safe fallback line), TTS client for the spoken brief (§3.17). Live agent **created in Mike's ElevenLabs workspace** (`agent_1901kyyxyj2sf9nsx9jascy2ssxj`, voice George, full guarded prompt) via the connector — running on the built-in LLM until the bridge is deployed, then it flips to custom-LLM so the guard is code, not prompt. | ◐ | `voice.test.ts` (15) — offline; **to go live: deploy server (O1) + point agent's custom LLM at the bridge + phone number** |

**Acceptance (Phase 2):** scripted test calls prove — **never** says a price
(even when the model tries) ✅, **never** diagnoses ✅, never leaks Suffolk/TCIA
✅, qualifies correctly ✅, escalates emergencies ✅, captures a clean lead ✅.
Guardrail suite run **twice**, green both times. The one remaining item (2.7) is
the telephony wiring, which needs external accounts.

### Phase 2 audit (§11) — result
85 tests pass (×2 runs), typecheck + lint clean. 1) Guardrails ✅ enforced in
code (output guard) — the model cannot quote a price or diagnose; caller can't
override. 2) Legal gates ✅ disclosure line is in the prompt. 3) Tests ✅ 4) No
regressions ✅ (Phase 0/1 suites still green). 5) Data integrity ✅ (lead capture
reuses the deduping repositories). 6) Secrets clean ✅. 7) Docs current ✅.
8) Scope honest ✅ (no 5B/5C). 9) Rabbit-hole: one named open item — Vapi/Twilio
wiring (2.7) needs accounts; the brain is complete and fully tested behind
injected interfaces.

### Phase 1 audit (§11) — result (partial phase)
`npm run check` green: **36 tests pass, 4 live-integration skipped** (run once
service-role key is in `.env`), typecheck + lint clean. Supabase security
advisor: clean (the `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO notes are intentional — §4.3
service-role-only). 1) Guardrails ✅ 2) Legal gates ✅ (configured) 3) Tests ✅
4) No regressions ✅ 5) Data integrity ✅ (FKs + cascade + dedupe verified live)
6) Secrets clean ✅ 7) Docs current ✅ 8) Scope honest ✅ 9) Rabbit-hole: one
named open item — Drive integration (1.8) needs Google creds; not silently
half-built.

### Repo consolidation — merged into `artistreellc/Arbo`
Full Phase 0–3 history merged into the Arbo repo (unrelated-histories merge;
final tree byte-identical to the incubator branch). The pre-brief generic-CRM
detour on Arbo main is parked (D25). One named open item: live-DB drift
rollback awaiting Mike's approval (D26). `npm run check` re-verified green
post-merge (see below).

## App surface pull-forward (Mike-directed) — Morning Brief + backend service

Pulled forward at Mike's direction (D27); §5A #25 is normally Phase 8, but the
app surface needed something visible and it reads purely from spine data.

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| PF.1 | Morning Brief assembler — route order (emergencies → jobs → ZIP-by-ZIP estimates), first-timer/repeat tags, red flags (§3.11, §5A #25, §9) | ☑ | `morningBrief.test.ts` (5) |
| PF.2 | Interactive app design preview (`design/app-preview.html`: Brief / Inbox / Approve / Property twin, §9 tokens, glove-scale, both themes; sample data, clearly labeled) | ☑ | n/a (static preview) |
| PF.3 | Backend service (`src/server.ts`): node:http, guardrails+legal validated at boot, no PII/stack traces on the wire (§4.3, §8) | ☑ | `api.test.ts` (5) |
| PF.4 | API handlers (`src/server/api.ts`): `/health`, `/api/brief`, `/api/leads` (with hot/warm/cool read §3.14) over an injected DataSource | ☑ | `api.test.ts` |
| PF.5 | Live DataSource + read repos (`listLeads`, `listStopsBetween`) over the Phase 1 spine | ☑ | typecheck; `api.test.ts` behind injected source |
| PF.6 | **The ARBOR app** (`src/app/index.html`, served at `/`): mobile-first single-file ops UI on the §9 tokens — Today (brief summary chips, ZIP run, ordered stops with red flags) + Leads (hot/warm/cool, emergency, §6B permit flags incl. screen-pending; never says "clear"). `APP_ACCESS_KEY` gate on `/api/*`, fail-closed with a connected DB (§4.3) | ☑ | `appUi.test.ts` (7) |
| PF.7 | **Deployed on Railway** (D40): project `arbor`, push-to-deploy from `main`, healthcheck `/health`, `https://arbor-server-production.up.railway.app` — deploys via GitHub Actions `railway up` (D43) — needs only the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` repo secret | ◐ | live `/health` check pending GitHub App install |
| PF.8 | **Deployed on Vercel with zero GitHub dependency** (D41): esbuild-bundled function + policy/legal/app sidecars, all routes → one handler (`createArborRequestHandler()`, same law as node:http). Production: `https://arbor-artistree.vercel.app` | ◐ | bundle smoke-tested locally (health/app/api 200s); live URL verification pending build completion |

## Phase 5/6 pull-forward — inbox lead recognition + follow-up queue (§5A #12, #16–20)

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| P56.1 | Lead-mail classifier over the REAL notification stream: Google Ads lead forms, CallRail (tracker = source tag, duration, repeat signal, Tagged-as), LSA calls; out-of-area flagged for review, marketing mail never lead-ified (D42) | ☑ | `leadMail.test.ts` (6) |
| P56.2 | Follow-up engine: 2-day estimate cadence (+ proof of insurance on first, #17), review request 1d after paid (#18), no-show saver (#20); consent/STOP/quiet-hours gates in CODE; recommend-only (§5B #1); migration 0007 applied live | ☑ | `leadMail.test.ts` (9) |
| P56.3 | `/api/followups` + app **Follow-ups tab** ("ARBOR recommends — nothing sends without you") | ☑ | typecheck + smoke; engine fully covered offline |
| P56.4 | Live Gmail inbox monitor loop (poll/push wiring at deploy) | ☐ | deploy-time (needs Google creds on the host) |
| P56.5 | **Write side / app buttons** (D44): outcome taps (won/lost/no-show), Mark-sent per follow-up card (the only cadence-advancer) | ☑ | `stormWatch.test.ts` API suite |
| P56.6 | **Storm watch #26** (D44): NWS alerts per city centroid (verified live), work-stopping filter, at-risk stop flags, Today-tab banner; feed-down ≠ clear skies | ☑ | `stormWatch.test.ts` (7) |
| P56.7 | **Repeat-customer memory #27** (D45): one-line property history on every lead card ("🌳 Job done & paid Mar 2025 — oak removal"); auxiliary — fetch failure never kills the inbox | ☑ | `memoryOutreach.test.ts` |
| P56.8 | **Pre-storm outreach #19** (D45): storm-triggered only, past customers in affected cities, consent/STOP/quiet-hours gated, recommend-only; `seasonalUnavailable` honesty flag | ☑ | `memoryOutreach.test.ts` |
| P56.9 | **Spoken brief §3.17** (D45): `/api/brief/audio` — brief → drive-time speech → ElevenLabs MP3; 503 until the real key | ☑ | `memoryOutreach.test.ts` |

## Phase 4 — Permitting & CBPA/RPA screening engine (§6B, §5A #30)

High value, legally sensitive — front-loads the highest-risk piece first: the
screen that is **structurally incapable of saying "you're clear."**

| # | Task | Status | Test |
|---|------|--------|------|
| 4.1 | Screening engine core — `ScreenStatus` has exactly 3 values (PERMIT_LIKELY / REVIEW_NEEDED / NO_OVERLAY_VERIFY); no CLEAR value exists in the type; `verifyWithCity` always true (§6B.3, §12) | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` (12) |
| 4.2 | Per-city ruleset config — VB (Accela/PPR, reference impl), Norfolk, Chesapeake (eBUILD tiers), Portsmouth (WQIA); forms, portals, contacts, mitigation, **dated `lastVerified`** (§6B.4/4b) | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` |
| 4.3 | Overlay coverage beyond CBPA — FEMA flood, local floodplain/land-disturbance, Norfolk CRO, city tree ordinance; plain-English "what it means" (§6B.4c) | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` |
| 4.4 | Mitigation surfacing (3:1, min 3.5" DBH) on PERMIT_LIKELY removals; Chesapeake scale tiers (site-visit / Board hearing) | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` |
| 4.5 | Power-line routing (§6B.4d) — utility-first, High Voltage Safety Act, ≥ REVIEW_NEEDED; `assertNeverClear` structural guard | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` |
| 4.6 | **"Never say clear" test run twice** (Phase 4 acceptance) — every reachable result across all 4 cities × input shapes × overlay sets | ☑ | `screening.test.ts` (pass 1 + pass 2) |
| 4.7 | Permit entity in the spine — migration `0003_permit.sql` (§7 fields; `screen_status` CHECK mirrors the type, no "clear" storable; RLS service-role-only) | ☑ | schema CHECK; `permit.integration.test.ts` (guarded) |
| 4.8 | Screen→permit bridge + repo (`createPermit`, `getLatestPermitForProperty`, `updatePermitStatus`) — lifecycle needed→applied→approved/not_required_verified | ☑ | `permitRecord.test.ts`, `permit.integration.test.ts` |
| 4.9 | **Crew clearance gate (§6B.3)** — `crewMayStart()` blocks protected work (PERMIT_LIKELY / REVIEW_NEEDED / in-RPA) until a human resolves the permit; `not_required_verified` is never inferred from a screen | ☑ | `permitRecord.test.ts` (7) |
| 4.10 | **Intake auto-screen (§6B.1 step 1)** — lead capture screens the property the moment the address lands: `intakeScreen.ts` (honest PENDING when GIS is absent/down — never a fabricated NO_OVERLAY_VERIFY; failures never lose the lead), wired into the live LeadSink; `crewMayStartForProperty(null)` = blocked ("no screen on file is not clearance") | ☑ | `intakeScreen.test.ts` (11), `permitRecord.test.ts` (9) |
| 4.11 | Screen flag rides the lead into the inbox — `/api/leads` carries `permit` + `screenPending` (property with no screen on file is surfaced, never assumed fine); permit-join failure degrades the flag, never kills the inbox | ☑ | `api.test.ts` (6), `permit.integration.test.ts` (guarded) |
| 4.12 | **Live GisProvider stack** (`src/permitting/gis/`) — strict ArcGIS point-in-polygon client, VA-constrained Google geocoder, per-city dated layer registry (DEQ statewide CBPA baseline + city layers), provider that throws (→ honest PENDING) on no-verified-layers / geocode failure / any single layer failure. Candidate endpoints recorded with sources; **none marked live yet** (gov GIS hosts egress-blocked from this env) — a tripwire test fails if one is flipped live without updating the verification evidence | ☑ | `gis.test.ts` (14) |
| 4.13 | **Packet assembly (§6B.1 step 6, #34)** — `assemblePacket()`: per-city checklist (forms/map/photos/owner/contractor), named missing items, mitigation surfaced up front, hand-off target (portal + contact) for MIKE; `neverAutoFiled: true` structural, no submit function exists; forbidden-string scan on output | ☑ | `packet.test.ts` (7) |
| 4.14 | **Sage won-recolor (D36, resolves O5)** — `markEstimateWonOnCalendar()` flips a won estimate's event to Sage 2 (the only path that writes it); `CalendarApi.updateEventColor` (PATCH); `estimate.calendar_event_id` via migration 0004 (**applied live**); `convertEstimateToJob` returns the event id; D26 rollback file updated to keep the now-legit column | ☑ | `scheduling.test.ts` (won-recolor + never-Sage-on-new-bookings) |
| 4.15 | **GIS endpoints verified + DEQ RPA layer LIVE (D37)** — layer 33 metadata/coverage/point-evidence verified over connector infra; proximity tier (direct → PERMIT_LIKELY, 300 m probe → `CBPA_RPA_PROXIMITY` → REVIEW_NEEDED); keyless Census geocoder default; `createDefaultGisProvider()` now always returns a provider | ☑ | `gis.test.ts` (20) |
| 4.16 | **D26 drift removed from the live DB** — roll-forward migration `0005` applied via the DDL tooling; verified live (tables/columns) | ☑ | live `list_tables` + column checks |
| 4.17 | **Permit-history mining (§5A #35, D38)** — `permitMail.ts` classifier (city domains, Accela case-ref formats incl. DSC/UTIL/J##-RPA, VB review-letter address pattern, kinds: ppr_review / cbpa_case / intake_request / duplicate_warning / payment); migration `0006_permit_correspondence` (**applied live**); **22 real cases mined from the live inbox and indexed** — incl. the brief's own 2025-DSC-021160 example, the VOIDED duplicate 2025-DSC-022094, both Norfolk CBPA violation cases, the Britannica Admin Variance chain, and the DWR eagles-nest coordination; VB ruleset enriched (Accela-help contact, Admin Variance path, DWR coordination) | ☑ | `permitMail.test.ts` (7); 22 rows live |

## O4 RESOLVED — color map learned from the live calendar (2026-08-01)

Analyzed 250 real events (Apr–Jul 2026) from the Art-is-Tree Google Calendar:

| colorId | Meaning (observed) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 4 Flamingo | **Virginia Beach** visits | 93/93 VB locations |
| 10 Basil | **Norfolk** visits | 16/16 Norfolk |
| 5 Banana | **Chesapeake** visits | 6/6 Chesapeake |
| 6 Tangerine | **Portsmouth** visits | 3 Portsmouth (+1 historical out-of-area) |
| 11 Tomato | **Payments/financial only** | 14/14 payment titles — D21 confirmed |
| default | Booked **jobs** / admin | job-titled + address-only events |
| 2 Sage | **Job WON** (O5 resolved — Mike confirmed) | cross-city + REPEAT-heavy fits: winners come from every city |

Also learned: the real title format is **space-separated** (`Peter Simmons TT
7578193493`), not the brief's hyphenated draft — code updated to match (D34).
Two historical Suffolk-location events exist on the calendar (pre-drop, Mike's
own entries — informational only; ARBOR can never create one).

## D26 — RESOLVED (roll-forward migration 0005, applied live)

The drift cleanup ran as a standard roll-forward migration
(`0005_remove_detour_drift.sql`, applied to the live `arbor` project via the
DDL tooling): the three `app_*` tables and `lead.external_id` are gone —
verified live (14 tables = 13-table spine + `permit`; column checks pass).
History stays append-only: the two detour migration rows remain as record,
and replaying 0001→0005 on a fresh DB yields the identical schema (all drops
are `if exists`). `estimate.calendar_event_id` is kept (legitimized by 0004).
The earlier hand-run rollback file is deleted — superseded.

## GIS endpoints — VERIFIED LIVE (4.15); screens now run end-to-end keyless

Build-env egress blocks the gov GIS hosts, so verification ran over the
connected Zapier webhook infrastructure (2026-08-01):

- **DEQ EDMA layer 33 "Resource Protection Area (RPA)"** — polygon Feature
  Layer, Query capability; distinct LOCALITY includes all four service
  cities. Layer **flipped to `live`**. (Layer 32 — the original candidate —
  turned out to be a non-queryable GROUP layer; corrected. The
  candidate-vs-live gate caught exactly what it was built to catch.)
- **The Circle Drive lesson (D37):** the known violation address geocodes to
  the street centerline; direct point-intersects = 0 hits, 75 m = 0,
  150 m = 0, **300 m = 1**. A bare point test would have missed the real
  case. The provider now runs two tiers: direct hit → `CBPA_RPA`
  (PERMIT_LIKELY on removals); probe-only hit within 300 m →
  `CBPA_RPA_PROXIMITY` (REVIEW_NEEDED). Inland control at 300 m: 0 hits.
- **Keyless geocoding:** US Census geocoder (verified live — it resolved
  Circle Drive) is the default when no Google Maps key is set, so the whole
  §6B screen pipeline runs live with **zero paid credentials**.

**Deferred to deploy / later (named, not silent):** live city GIS layer wiring
(the injected `GisProvider`), geocoding, form-PDF retrieval, the interactive
map + tree-labeling tool (§6B.2, mobile — Phase 11), and packet assembly +
city handoff (§6B.1 steps 2–6). Same deferral pattern as Vapi/Twilio (2.7) and
Drive OAuth (O3): the classification brain is complete and fully tested behind
an injected interface; nothing is half-built.

**Migration 0003 APPLIED to the live `arbor` project** (Supabase tooling became
available mid-session): `permit` table live with RLS enabled; all three CHECK
constraints verified in pg_catalog (city ∈ 4 cities; screen_status ∈ the three
no-clear values; lifecycle ∈ needed/applied/approved/not_required_verified).
Security advisor: only the intentional D11 `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO notes.
The D26 drift rollback (destructive) still awaits Mike's approval.

### Phase 4 audit (§11) — result (checkpoint after 4.7–4.9)
`npm run check` green: **145 tests pass, 7 live-integration skipped**, typecheck
+ lint clean. 1) Guardrails ✅ (permit engine still cannot emit a "clear"; both
the type and the DB CHECK enforce it). 2) Legal gates ✅ (no outbound path
added). 3) Tests ✅ 145/145 run. 4) No regressions ✅. 5) Data integrity ✅
(permit FKs cascade from property, set-null from job; migration mirrors code
types). 6) Secrets clean ✅ (city-office contacts are public, not PII/secrets).
7) Docs current ✅ (this update; D28–D31). 8) Scope honest ✅ (all Phase 4 = #30
CONFIRMED). 9) Rabbit-holes: carried — D26 drift rollback + migration 0003
apply (both need live DB), live-GIS wiring, O4 color map. All named.

### Post-merge audit (§11) — result
`npm run check` green: **138 tests pass, 4 live-integration skipped**,
typecheck + lint clean. 1) Guardrails ✅ (price/diagnosis/Suffolk/TCIA suites
green; merged code adds no price/diagnosis path; permit engine cannot output a
"clear"). 2) Legal gates ✅ (unchanged; the new API is read-only GET — no
outbound path added; server never logs PII/stack traces). 3) Tests ✅ 138/138.
4) No regressions ✅ (all prior suites green). 5) Data integrity ✅ (new repos
are read-only joins; no writes). 6) Secrets clean ✅ (`secrets.test.ts`). 7)
Docs current ✅ (this update). 8) Scope honest ✅ — Morning Brief (#25) is a
CONFIRMED feature pulled forward with Mike's OK (D27); Phase 4 is #30 CONFIRMED;
nothing from 5B/5C built. 9) Rabbit-holes: carried — D26 live-DB drift rollback
(needs Mike's approval); Phase 4 live-GIS wiring (deferred above); O4 calendar
color map. All named.

### "Connect them" — live app ↔ live DB (2026-08-01, verified)
The production Vercel app is fully connected to the live Supabase project with
zero remaining action items. Root cause of the earlier 500s: the dashboard env
values were malformed phone-pastes (presence-only health checks can't see
that). Fix is D46 — trimmed env, shape-validated Supabase credentials
(`getShaped()`), and a gitignored `private/deploy.config.json` carried only
inside the private deployment upload as backstop. Verified live over the
sanctioned webhook path: `/health` → `db:true`; `/api/leads` → 200 with the
real seeded lead row; `/api/followups` → 200 (empty queue, seasonal feed
healthy); `/api/brief` → 200 with a valid window. Dashboard env vars remain
Mike's to fix/delete at leisure — well-formed env always wins over carried.
Recommended (non-blocking): rotate the service-role key eventually, since it
transited chat during setup.

### Location intelligence + review loop (§5A #21–24, #29) — built 2026-08-02
`locationIntel.ts` (pure engine, 16 new tests): §24 working-hours + master-
switch law in code, 150 m/2-ping geofence visits, straight-line running-late
assessment that degrades to the soft "running a little behind" draft (guard-
checked) instead of inventing an ETA. Migration 0008 applied live:
`location_ping` (72 h retention on the write path), `ops_setting`,
`conversation_log`, `estimate.visited_at`. New key-gated routes:
POST /api/location/{ping,tracking}, GET /api/location/{status,day},
GET /api/review/backlog, POST /api/review/:id/reviewed. The voice bridge now
appends every turn to conversation_log (best-effort — a dead log never drops
a caller). App: Today-tab tracking pill + running-late banner with the
send-it-yourself draft. Deploy-time reality, named honestly: pings need a
sender (an iPhone Shortcut posting to /api/location/ping is the zero-app
path); geofencing/visits work the moment pings flow. 268 tests green.

### Secret rotation status (2026-08-02)
ELEVENLABS_BRIDGE_SECRET rotated (ours to mint; ships in the deployment-
carried config — nothing external used the old one yet). The two remaining
hygiene items are dashboard-gated and NOT reachable from this environment's
sanctioned tools (the Supabase MCP deliberately exposes no key management;
the Vercel MCP has no env-var surface): (1) rotating the Supabase
service_role key — verified still live; (2) deleting the three corrupt
Vercel env vars — harmless since D46 shape-validation ignores them. Both are
60-second dashboard clicks whenever Mike wants; D46 means neither blocks
anything, and a rotated key ships into the carried config on the next
deploy with one paste.

### Deploy verification (2026-08-02)
Deployment `dpl_HaLUaeNXg1mzUDdyE7EME9KPJbaL` READY on production
(arbor-artistree.vercel.app), carrying the rotated bridge secret. Verified
live over the webhook path: /health 200 db:true; /api/location/status 200
(tracking OFF by default, late=no_data); /api/review/backlog 200 (empty);
/api/leads 200 with the real seeded row. Full loop green end-to-end.

### §6 Predictive Property Intelligence (#28, the centerpiece) — built 2026-08-02
`growthForecast.ts` (8 new tests, 276 total green): species-routed
maintenance cycles over each tree's real `last_service_date` — no history,
no forecast. `GET /api/forecast` lists due/overdue properties worst-first
and back-fills `tree.next_due_forecast` (the D12 column, live at last).
Growth nudges join /api/followups through the same §4 gates as seasonal
("COMING DUE" badge in the app), recommend-only, with `growthUnavailable`
honesty on twin-read failure. Also fixed: Mark-sent button now only renders
on cadence-bearing queue items. The layer compounds automatically: every
completed job that records tree service dates feeds next season's queue.

### §6 deploy verification (2026-08-02)
Deployment `dpl_8ZrZNonS2NE2UpNpRQnhUc9sC3me` READY on production. Verified
live: /health 200 db:true; /api/forecast 200 `{"due":[],"basis":"general
growth cycles — recommend a look, never a diagnosis"}` (empty until tree
service dates accumulate — by design); /api/followups 200 with both
honesty flags false. The centerpiece is live; it compounds from here.

### Phase 5 live: inbox monitor + calendar sync running on a schedule (2026-08-02)
First backfill sweep (14-day window) executed per docs/OPS_SWEEP.md:
40 lead-inbox threads → 36 leads (1 flagged out-of-area, never dropped),
24 deduped contacts, 4 non-lead reports labeled; 0 new city mails;
calendar → 8 booked jobs upserted (keyed on calendar_event_id), 5 events
skipped-and-counted, payment-reminder color respected. DB: lead 1→37,
contact 0→24, job 0→8, property 0→10. Hourly Routine
`trig_01YcQqopGmrwJMfwEEtuA3L9` now re-runs the sweep (2-day windows,
self-binding to the ops session; PII never in chat, counts only; its prompt
self-checks connector availability and reports honestly if a firing lacks
tools). Rule-review note from run 1: short name+phone calendar events may
be estimate visits — the estimate/job title heuristic in OPS_SWEEP.md
deserves tightening once Mike confirms his conventions.

### Railway deploy path fixed (2026-08-02) — corrected diagnosis
The red X's Mike saw: GitHub builds a Docker action's image BEFORE
evaluating the step's `if` guard, and jzeuzs/action-railway's image broke
upstream (it pipes Railway's installer into plain `sh`; the script's
bash-only substitution dies, exit 2). So every push failed at action
setup even though the deploy step itself would have been SKIPPED —
RAILWAY_TOKEN is in fact still not visible to Actions (run #17 with the
fix skipped green on the token guard, and Railway answers "Application
not found": nothing has ever deployed there). deploy-railway.yml now
installs the official @railway/cli and runs `railway up --service
arbor-server --detach` directly — no third-party image to break. Pushes
are green again; the Railway path lights up the day a repository secret
named exactly RAILWAY_TOKEN exists (Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions → Repository secrets). Until then Vercel remains the live
production path, unaffected throughout.

### Incident: git-connect clobbered production (2026-08-02, resolved)
The Vercel project got linked to GitHub (new arbor-git-main domain), so doc
pushes started triggering git builds that took over production WITHOUT the
deployment-carried config — leaving only the corrupt dashboard env vars, so
every DB endpoint 500'd while presence-only /health stayed green. Fix:
repo-root vercel.json sets git.deploymentEnabled=false (git pushes no longer
deploy this project; the private file-tree upload remains the only deploy
path, D41/D46), and the known-good build was redeployed on top.

### The deep app shipped (§9/#36) — 2026-08-03 early hours
After Mike's honest verdict on the thin 3-tab UI, the app grew into the
brief's shape in one sitting: Book tab (every property + coming-due merged),
the twin sheet ("know this customer instantly" — history, trees, permits,
correspondence), tap-to-call-back with CALL BACK accents on
missed/abandoned/voicemail leads, one-tap qualify/spam, Calls tab (§29
backlog + mark-reviewed), Route-the-day button, then a §9 design pass
(warm paper palette, native serif display type, calmed badges — the
self-containment test correctly rejected an external font) and a desktop
layout (Mike reviews on a monitor). Deployed + verified live:
dpl_7j7LrtvWDfmQZQ2fU7DgFi8ciUym — and the report confirms Mike attached
arborgrow.app to the project: the app now serves on his own domain.
Still open from §9/6B: permit packet builder + tree-labeling map, photos
in the twin, installable PWA wrapper, spoken-brief button (needs the
ElevenLabs key).
