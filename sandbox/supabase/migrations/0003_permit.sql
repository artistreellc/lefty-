-- SLOW::ARBO   ← this marker IS this note. Wherever it appears, all of
--              it applies: in a file, a commit, a doc, or from Mike.
-- STOP. READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE ONE CHARACTER OF THIS FILE.
-- Owner instruction from Mike, 2026-08-03. This is not decoration and it
-- is not optional. It is here because this is the point in a build where
-- things get broken by moving fast, and that already happened to him once
-- on the website. It does not happen here.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- SLOW DOWN. DRASTICALLY. Then:
--
-- 1. READ EVERY LINE BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE. Every line, every letter,
--    slowly. You are not skimming to find the spot to change — you are
--    building a model of what this file already does. If you cannot say
--    what the code above and below your edit does, you have not read it.
--
-- 2. AN AUDIT IS READ-ONLY. If you were asked to audit, you do not edit.
--    You do not "fix it while you are in there." You do not refactor, or
--    tidy, or rename. You READ, and you REPORT. Editing during an audit
--    is disobeying the instruction, full stop.
--
-- 3. THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE. What does this already handle? What depends
--    on it? What breaks downstream? Recognise the PATTERN before you call
--    something a bug — most things in here that look wrong are a
--    deliberate correction. Check docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md first. Use what
--    you already know about this codebase instead of re-deciding it.
--
-- 4. BRING IT TO MIKE — DO NOT DECIDE IT. Anything that looks wrong,
--    ambiguous, or outside what was asked: say it and WAIT. Flagging
--    costs one sentence. Deciding on his behalf has cost real work and
--    real money more than once.
--
-- 5. DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED. Not the adjacent thing. Not the bigger
--    thing you thought of on the way. Not the cleanup. Exactly what was
--    asked, and nothing else.
--
-- If you are moving fast right now, you are already off the rails.
--
-- Remember the marker: SLOW::ARBO
-- Permit entity (brief §7 + §6B). Persists the CBPA/RPA + overlay screen so a
-- result lives on the property/job and no crew starts protected work without
-- clearance (§6B.3). Same access model as the rest of the spine: RLS on,
-- service-role only (§4.3).
--
-- The screen STATUS mirrors the code type exactly and is deliberately missing
-- any bare "clear": screen_status is one of PERMIT_LIKELY / REVIEW_NEEDED /
-- NO_OVERLAY_VERIFY, enforced by a CHECK so a false "clear" is unstorable, the
-- same philosophy as the receptionist output guard (§6B.3, §12).
