  SLOW::ARBO   ← this marker IS this note. Wherever it appears, all of
               it applies: in a file, a commit, a doc, or from Mike.
  STOP. READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE ONE CHARACTER OF THIS FILE.
  Owner instruction from Mike, 2026-08-03. This is not decoration and it
  is not optional. It is here because this is the point in a build where
  things get broken by moving fast, and that already happened to him once
  on the website. It does not happen here.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SLOW DOWN. DRASTICALLY. Then:

  1. READ EVERY LINE BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE. Every line, every letter,
     slowly. You are not skimming to find the spot to change — you are
     building a model of what this file already does. If you cannot say
     what the code above and below your edit does, you have not read it.

  2. AN AUDIT IS READ-ONLY. If you were asked to audit, you do not edit.
     You do not "fix it while you are in there." You do not refactor, or
     tidy, or rename. You READ, and you REPORT. Editing during an audit
     is disobeying the instruction, full stop.

  3. THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE. What does this already handle? What depends
     on it? What breaks downstream? Recognise the PATTERN before you call
     something a bug — most things in here that look wrong are a
     deliberate correction. Check docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md first. Use what
     you already know about this codebase instead of re-deciding it.

  4. BRING IT TO MIKE — DO NOT DECIDE IT. Anything that looks wrong,
     ambiguous, or outside what was asked: say it and WAIT. Flagging
     costs one sentence. Deciding on his behalf has cost real work and
     real money more than once.

  5. DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED. Not the adjacent thing. Not the bigger
     thing you thought of on the way. Not the cleanup. Exactly what was
     asked, and nothing else.

  If you are moving fast right now, you are already off the rails.

  Remember the marker: SLOW::ARBO

// Lead-notification mail classifier (brief §5A #12–13): recognizes an incoming

// Art-is-Tree's REAL notification formats (mined 2026-08-01):
//   - Google Ads lead form: ads-account-noreply@google.com,
//     "Lead form response received", labeled fields in plaintext
//     (First name / Last name / Phone number / City / Street address / Response).
//   - CallRail call alert: no-reply@callrail.com,
//     "Call from <who> via <TRACKER> for Art-is-Tree LLC (VA)" — Name/Number/
//     Duration/"Number Name" (the tracker = Mike's source tag, e.g. TSP, TLT),
//     "Tagged as <label>", "New Caller"/"2nd call" repeat signal.
//   - Google LSA: localservices-noreply@google.com, "New call from a potential
//     customer".
// Pure classifier — Phase 5 wires the live inbox monitor around it. Out-of-area
// submissions (lead-form spam arrives from anywhere) are flagged, never
// silently dropped: §3.7 bias — anything ambiguous stays visible for review.

 *   "Not worried about Angi or homeadivsor we are not going after them

 *    them seasonally"
 *
 * HomeAdvisor and Angi are the same company, so the sender match below covers

 * day they send any.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SWITCH AND NOT A DELETION. Mike said "I'll let you know when",
 * so this comes back. Deleting the parser would mean rebuilding it — and
 * rebuilding a lead parser from memory is how a channel comes back subtly
 * wrong. Flip the array; the rule is already written and already tested.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not make the mail invisible. The classifier
 * still recognises it and returns `channelOff: 'home_advisor'`, so a sweep
 * can say "4 HomeAdvisor mails, channel off" instead of either counting them
 * as leads or silently dropping them (§3.7). Off is a stated fact, not a

/**
 * THE WEBSITE CONTACT FORM (FormSubmit), Mike 2026-08-03: "Arbo can address

 * of scope — his rankings are a live business asset. Reading the notification
 * email that FormSubmit already sends to his inbox touches none of that: no
 * DNS, no site config, no form endpoint change. Gmail only.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS MAIL IS HTML-ONLY. THERE IS NO PLAINTEXT PART.

 * sweep to read `plaintextBody`, which for FormSubmit is EMPTY — so a sweep
 * following the runbook literally would extract nothing and record a lead with
 * no name, no phone and no address. That is the §1B failure exactly: absence
 * of data rendering as absence of a customer. So this parser reads the HTML
 * table, and `fieldFromHtml` is written for the shape FormSubmit actually
 * sends rather than a tidied-up idea of it.
 *
 * The real shape:
 *   subject  "New estimate request from <name> — <service>"  (em dash)
 *   body     <tr><td><strong>KEY</strong></td><td><pre>VALUE</pre></td></tr>
 *   keys     name · phone · email · address · serviceNeeded · urgency · message
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CARRY: city, state, ZIP. The address is a bare street line
 * ("4500 Medford Ct"), so `inServiceArea` stays NULL — unknown, never false.
 * Same rule as LSA: a form with no city is not an out-of-area form.
