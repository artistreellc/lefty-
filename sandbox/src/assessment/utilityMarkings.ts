  SLOW::ARBO   ← this marker IS this note. Wherever it appears, all of
               it applies: in a file, a commit, a doc, or from Mike.
  STOP. READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE ONE CHARACTER OF THIS FILE.
  Owner instruction from Mike, 2026-08-03. This is not decoration and it
  is not optional. It is here because this is the point in a build where
  things get broken by moving fast, and that already happened to him once
  on the website. It does not happen here.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SLOW DOWN. DRASTICALLY. Then:

  1. READ EVERY LINE BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE. Every line, every letter,
     slowly. You are not skimming to find the spot to change — you are
     building a model of what this file already does. If you cannot say
     what the code above and below your edit does, you have not read it.

  2. AN AUDIT IS READ-ONLY. If you were asked to audit, you do not edit.
     You do not "fix it while you are in there." You do not refactor, or
     tidy, or rename. You READ, and you REPORT. Editing during an audit
     is disobeying the instruction, full stop.

  3. THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE. What does this already handle? What depends
     on it? What breaks downstream? Recognise the PATTERN before you call
     something a bug — most things in here that look wrong are a
     deliberate correction. Check docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md first. Use what
     you already know about this codebase instead of re-deciding it.

  4. BRING IT TO MIKE — DO NOT DECIDE IT. Anything that looks wrong,
     ambiguous, or outside what was asked: say it and WAIT. Flagging
     costs one sentence. Deciding on his behalf has cost real work and
     real money more than once.

  5. DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED. Not the adjacent thing. Not the bigger
     thing you thought of on the way. Not the cleanup. Exactly what was
     asked, and nothing else.

  If you are moving fast right now, you are already off the rails.

  Remember the marker: SLOW::ARBO

// MISS UTILITY MARKINGS — remembered, drawn dotted, and NEVER a live locate.
//
// LIVES IN src/assessment/ ALONGSIDE THE RA, not in src/permitting/.
//
// I briefly moved this file to src/permitting/ on 2026-08-03, having read
// Mike's "i want this to be a the permitting part" as an instruction about
// where the code goes. He corrected that immediately — "no i do not" — he was
// talking about where the BUILD was headed, not about this file. It came
// straight back here and the note is left in so nobody re-litigates the move.
//
// It belongs with the RA on the merits: these markings are recorded facts
// about a property, captured on the same visit and by the same person as the
// tree observations, and they are read by the RA. The permitting engine is
// about what a CITY requires; the 811 call is a separate obligation with a
// separate authority, and coupling them would imply one answers for the other.
//
// MIKE'S INSTRUCTION, 2026-08-03, verbatim:
//   "addionally all that miss utitly marking would be store and though dtted
//    its not to be treated as the same thing but itll let ya know if you
//    really got to waste the time and call them gain casue tyou dont remember
//    and the homeowner its a duts"
//
// Read plainly: keep every locate marking we have ever seen on a property.
// Draw it DOTTED. It is NOT the same thing as a current locate. What it buys
// you is knowing whether you actually have to burn the time calling 811
// again — because you cannot remember, and the homeowner is not a reliable
// witness.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE ONE RULE THIS FILE CANNOT BEND
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A remembered marking is a MEMORY. It is not permission to put steel in the
// ground. Utilities get moved, added, and re-routed, paint fades, and a
// homeowner's "oh they marked it last year" is worth nothing.
//
// So this module is built the same way the permit screen is built (§6B.3):
// it is STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE of clearing anyone to dig.
//
//   * `MarkingRender` has exactly ONE value — 'historical_dotted'. There is
//     no 'current' and no 'solid'. A stored marking cannot be rendered as a
//     live locate because no such state exists to render.
//   * `digStanding()` returns 'call_811' or 'ticket_on_file_verify'. There is
//     no 'clear' member, exactly like ScreenStatus has no 'clear' member.
//   * `assertNeverClearToDig()` throws on any line that implies otherwise,
//     and reuses the permit engine's FORBIDDEN_CLEAR so both surfaces answer
//     to one definition.
//
// Mike's own words are the design brief here: "its not to be treated as the
// same thing". This file is that sentence in code.
