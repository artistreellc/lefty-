  SLOW::ARBO   ← this marker IS this note. Wherever it appears, all of
               it applies: in a file, a commit, a doc, or from Mike.
  STOP. READ THIS BEFORE YOU CHANGE ONE CHARACTER OF THIS FILE.
  Owner instruction from Mike, 2026-08-03. This is not decoration and it
  is not optional. It is here because this is the point in a build where
  things get broken by moving fast, and that already happened to him once
  on the website. It does not happen here.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  SLOW DOWN. DRASTICALLY. Then:

  1. READ EVERY LINE BEFORE YOU EDIT ONE. Every line, every letter,
     slowly. You are not skimming to find the spot to change — you are
     building a model of what this file already does. If you cannot say
     what the code above and below your edit does, you have not read it.

  2. AN AUDIT IS READ-ONLY. If you were asked to audit, you do not edit.
     You do not "fix it while you are in there." You do not refactor, or
     tidy, or rename. You READ, and you REPORT. Editing during an audit
     is disobeying the instruction, full stop.

  3. THINK BEFORE YOU TYPE. What does this already handle? What depends
     on it? What breaks downstream? Recognise the PATTERN before you call
     something a bug — most things in here that look wrong are a
     deliberate correction. Check docs/OWNER_RULINGS.md first. Use what
     you already know about this codebase instead of re-deciding it.

  4. BRING IT TO MIKE — DO NOT DECIDE IT. Anything that looks wrong,
     ambiguous, or outside what was asked: say it and WAIT. Flagging
     costs one sentence. Deciding on his behalf has cost real work and
     real money more than once.

  5. DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS ASKED. Not the adjacent thing. Not the bigger
     thing you thought of on the way. Not the cleanup. Exactly what was
     asked, and nothing else.

  If you are moving fast right now, you are already off the rails.

  Remember the marker: SLOW::ARBO
*/
// The in-app inbox watch (Mike, 2026-08-03: "Arbo can address the form
// submitted on website via Gmail access no need for site and it needs to run
// a sweep every 5 mins").
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AND NOT A SCHEDULED ROUTINE. The platform's scheduler has a
// one-hour floor — `*/5 * * * *` is rejected server-side — and a routine I
// create carries no Gmail connector, so it would have polled blind forever.
// A poller inside ARBO has no interval floor and no connector problem. The
// reader is injected, exactly like the GIS provider, so the whole engine is
// testable offline.
//
// What it still needs is NOT just a config value, and saying so plainly
// because the temptation is to write "drop in credentials": it needs a
// consumer-Gmail OAuth token with user consent. The service-account keys
// already in env cannot reach a personal mailbox. See src/integrations/
// gmail.ts and backlog #36 — that is Mike's call to make.
//
// ═══ THIS IS READ-ONLY, STRUCTURALLY (Ruling R4) ═══
// Scheduled sweeps scan, report, and write NOTHING — no lead rows, no Gmail
// labels, no calendar edits. That is not enforced here by discipline; it is
// enforced by the shape of `GmailReader`, which has exactly ONE method and it
// reads. There is no label call to forget to remove, because there is no
// label call. Same trick as `MarkingRender` having exactly one member.
//
// ═══ AND IT STORES NOTHING (§3, §4.3) ═══
// The data links are cut and leads are Mike's. This watch holds message IDS
// in memory to avoid re-reporting the same mail, and reports PRESENCE flags —
// "this lead has a phone number" — never the number itself. `assertNoPii()`
// runs on the real return path, so a future edit that widens the result into
// customer data fails loudly instead of quietly leaking into a log line.
